I build an CLI tool to validate and enhance basic client information.This code be written
in plain Ruby.It also verify the addresses, and fetch GEO coordinates for each
row. The output of my code invalid rows should be
removed. Here are some examples of invalid rows:
blank email, first and last name,
blank residential or postal addresses,
invalid location/postcode pair (residential or postal).
